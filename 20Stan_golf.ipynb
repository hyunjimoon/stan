    "Recently a local business school professor and golfer, Mark Broadie, came by my office with tons of new data. For simplicity we’ll just look here at the summary data, probabilities of the ball going into the hole for shots up to 75 feet from the hole. The graph below shows these new data (in red), along with our earlier dataset (in blue) and the already-fit geometry-based model from before, extending to the range of the new data.\n",

Supposing uu is the distance that golfer’s shot would travel if there were no hole, Broadie assumes that the putt will go in if (a) the angle allows the ball to go over the hole, and (b) uu is in the range [x,x+3]. That is the ball must be hit hard enough to reach the whole but not go too far. Factor (a) is what we have considered earlier; we must now add factor (b).\n",

    "The error term in the above model is a hack. It’s useful to allow the model not to fit the data perfectly, but it can’t be right to model these systematic errors as being independent. In this case, though, it doesn’t really matter, given how tiny these errors are: their estimated standard deviation is less than one percentage point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has two parameters that were fixed as data: `distance_tolerance`, which was set to 3 (implying that the ball will only fall into the hole if it is hit on a trajectory that would go past the hole, but no more than 3 feet past) and `overshot`, which was set to 1 (implying that the golfer will aim 1 foot past the hole). In theory it would be possible to estimate either or both these parameters from the data. In practice, no way. The model already fits the data so well (as shown by the above graph) that there’s clearly no more information available to estimate any additional parameters. If we were to do so, the estimates would be highly noisy and unstable (if their prior is weak) or highly dependent on the prior (if an informative prior distribution is specified). Either way we don’t see the advantage of this sort of fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just for laughs, though, we constructed such a model and fit it, just to see what would happen. We simply took our previous Stan program and moved these two parameters from the data block to the parameters block along with zero-boundary constraints:\n",

    "Fitting this model to the data yields poor convergence and no real gain beyond the simpler version already fit in which overshot and distance_tolerance were set to fixed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is unrealistic in other ways, for example by assuming distance error is strictly proportional to distance aimed, and assuming independence of angular and distance errors. Presumably, angular error is higher for longer putts. Again, though, we can’t really investigate such things well using these data which are already such a good fit to the simple two-parameter model we have already fit.\n",

Finally, we fit `golf_angle_distance_4` to `golf_new` but we didn’t display the fit, we just discussed it.\n",
