For simplicity we’ll just look here at the summary data, probabilities of the ball going into the hole for shots up to 75 feet from the hole. The graph below shows these new data (in red), along with our earlier dataset (in blue) and the already-fit geometry-based model from before, extending to the range of the new data.\n",
